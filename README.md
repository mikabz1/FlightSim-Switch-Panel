## project by Michael Benzekri.
# summary:
I am a computer science student, in addition I really like the world of aviation and deal a lot with flight simulators.
I wanted to improve my simulator experience and decided to make a switch panel for myself.
In addition to the pleasure of this, it is an opportunity to improve programming, construction planning and creativity skills.

At the beginning I planned the functionality that I want to have in the panel, meaning the buttons and actions I want the panel to know how to perform.
Next I decided on the dimensions of the panel.
And finally the selection of the parts and components and the beginning of the development itself.

I chose Arduino Leonardo for the controller because it communicates with the computer in the form of HID so that I can pretend it is a normal joystick and thus make programming easier.
Since I don't have a laser cutting machine/3D printer, I decided that the panel itself would be made of wood and the work on it would be manual.
In terms of the other components, I went for classic switches, a potentiometer and an encoder that I purchased online (aliexpress).
